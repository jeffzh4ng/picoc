picoc089: aot optimizing C89->RV32I compiler

goals: hackable. quakeable. -O1able.
non-goals: ld, as, objdump, gdb

usage:
cargo run interpretc0 ./path/to/file.c0
cargo run compilec89 ./path/to/file.c

--C0
snapped sublangs (arith, control, bindings, heap)
eyeballed typer/evaluator against c0's statics/dynamics
smoked with dsa
future goals: jit with c89's backend

--C89
bootstrapped with C0's frontend
fuzzed with csmith, diffed with clang
smoked with egos2000 (2k), xv6(10k), quake(300k), sqlite(400k)
optimized with inline, unroll, cse, dce, motion, fold, peephole
