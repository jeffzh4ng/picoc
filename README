picoc: aot optimizing C89->RV32I compiler

goals: hackable. quakeable. -O1able.
non-goals: as, ld, objdump, gdb

usage:
cargo run interpretc0 ./path/to/file.c0
cargo run compilec89 ./path/to/file.c

--C0
snapped sublangs (arith, control, bindings, heap)
eyeballed typer/evaluator against c0's statics/dynamics
smoked with dsa
todo: jit with C89's backend

--C89->RV32I
bootstrapped with C0's frontend
fuzzed with csmith, diffed with clang
optimized with inline, unroll, cse, dce, motion, fold, peephole
todo: support RISC-V modularity
